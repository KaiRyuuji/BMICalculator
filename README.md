# BMICalculator
Central Carolina Community College Assignment For WEB-151 - Mobile Development

This was my first quiz assessment for the class. I was tasked to make a BMI calculator in MIT App Inventor 2. You enter in your weight in lbs, your height in feet, and then the remaining inches. After you click the formula, the inches are converted to feet, added to the remaining feet, clears the text, tells you your BMI in numbers and a clear color, and finally adds a humurous, insulting little message (I got bored while doing my quiz).
